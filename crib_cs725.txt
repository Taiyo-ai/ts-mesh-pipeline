Q4
Radial Basis code not running:
Our implementation is almost correct. There were a couple of minor issues which were because we wrote the code in a jupyter notebook, which caches the variables across runs unless one restarts the kernel after every run. We need to replace "train_features" in liines 90 and 93 with "np_data", and size=11 in line 89 with size=12. Then the code will run without issues
